  <GravEngineInspectedLetterContents>Amongst the remnants of the crashed mechanoid platform, a still-intact grav engine hums with energy.\n\nYou can build gravship substructure around the engine to create a new gravship. The engine pushes against gravity, levitating the ship and allowing long-distance travel.\n\nLaunch a gravship by researching basic gravtech, then building fuel tanks, thrusters, and a pilot console.\n\nLaunching a gravship will abandon your current map unless you build a grav anchor first.\n\n  - Research unlocked: Basic gravtech\n  - Flooring unlocked: Gravship substructure</GravEngineInspectedLetterContents>

  <!-- Asteroid -->
  <AsteroidLetter>{RESOURCE} asteroid</AsteroidLetter> 
  <AsteroidLetterText>You've discovered the location of an asteroid orbiting the planet. It contains significant amounts of {RESOURCE}, and potentially other resources.\n\nOrbital miners steer valuable asteroids into planetary orbit so that they can be easily mined and sold to orbital traders. You do not detect any signs of life from this asteroid.\n\nYou can reach the asteroid with transport pods, shuttles, or a gravship.</AsteroidLetterText>

  <!-- Pursuing Mechanoids -->
  <LetterLabelMechanoidThreat>Incoming mechanoids</LetterLabelMechanoidThreat>
  <LetterTextMechanoidThreat>The mechhive's scanning process is close to determining your location. When it locates your gravship, it will send a massive mechanoid force to kill you.\n\nGather your supplies, then flee the map by selecting the pilot console, and selecting launch.</LetterTextMechanoidThreat>

  <!-- Mechhive -->
  <LetterLabelMechhiveWarning>Mechhive signal</LetterLabelMechhiveWarning>
  <LetterTextMechhiveWarning>You have detected a massive gravtech energy reading indicating that the mechhive is hidden somewhere in orbit. If you could find it, you could shut it down - or make use of its power.\n\nMechhives are production-and-control platforms that birth mechanoids and coordinate their actions around the planet. They're powered by a persona core.\n\nCollect more gravship technology to track down the mechhive's location.</LetterTextMechhiveWarning>

  <OrbitalMechhiveLetterArrived>Cerebrex core</OrbitalMechhiveLetterArrived>
  <OrbitalMechhiveLetterArrivedText>At the center of the orbital platform sits a massive mechanoid structure made of hair-fine ultratech filaments supporting an AI persona core.
